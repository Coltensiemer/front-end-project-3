## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript 
- css/scss 




### What I learned

The biggest challenge was to make the input options keyboard friendly, but also to have a design. To accomplish this, I need to use pseu ::before to get the display of the items along with the label. 


Secondly, have the html read the input and displaying it on the 'Thank you container'. The sitution was a for loop to run through the input values and display with innerhtml 

### Continued development

Using psudo elements of ::before and ::after need pratice. Learning this better will assist with better designs.
